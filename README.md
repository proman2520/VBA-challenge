 Andrew Prozorovsky Homework 2
Learning Assistants from AskBCS helped me with two parts: looping through worksheets and for loops reaching an unspecified limit of i. Code provided to me is limited to the following lines:
"For Each ws In Worksheets"
"dateRowCount = ws.Cells(Rows.Count, "B").End(xlUp).Row"
Beyond those lines of code, everything was completed by myself and the code written on my own. All of it can be found in the repository in the text file or in the macros of my VBA_stock_homework.
